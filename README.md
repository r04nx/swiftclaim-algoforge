## üîç Project Overview

Swift Claim is a revolutionary **AI and blockchain-powered platform** designed to transform how insurance claims are processed. Instead of being an insurance provider, we offer a cutting-edge technology platform that enables insurance companies to process claims 100x faster, with fraud-proof verification and at significantly lower operational costs.

> [!tip] Our Vision
> To create a world where insurance claims are processed instantly, transparently, and without friction, benefiting both insurers and policyholders.

The platform automates health & travel insurance claims using:
- ‚ö° Real-time data integration
- ü§ñ AI-powered verification
- üîó Blockchain-based execution
- üí∏ Instant UPI payouts

This eliminates paperwork, reduces human intervention, and minimizes delays in claim settlements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem

> [!warning] The Current Insurance Landscape
> The insurance industry remains outdated, bureaucratic, and cost-inefficient despite technological advancements in other financial sectors.

### Key Statistics

| Issue | Statistics | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Health Insurance Claims Processing Time | 15-90 days in India | Financial stress on families |
| Travel Insurance Claims | 40% of claims for flight delays/cancellations are delayed or rejected | Billions in unrecovered losses globally |
| Insurance Market Size | ‚Çπ24.35 trillion (India) | Growing at 12-15% CAGR |
| Fraud Detection | Manual verification processes | High operational costs and fraud risk |

Despite the massive market size and growth potential, no company has successfully implemented a fully automated AI + blockchain-powered claims solution that addresses these fundamental issues.
